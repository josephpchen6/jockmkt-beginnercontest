Quick script to find the largest pre/post IPO increases in value in Jock MKT's beginner contests.

In beginner contests, Jock MKT tends to increase players' value players post-IPO. So by buying the players with the largest increase in value pre IPO, and then subsequently selling them, you can get ~150 free coins, which is enough to at least place in certain contests. Or you could use this coin "bonus" to actually purchase player stocks.

Usage:
1) Delete readme.txt in jock_mkt_data
2) Download contest data as .csv and place file in jock_mkt_data
3) Run script: if you are looking to SELL, then look at the highest entries in "Tax Adjusted Profit/Coin" and buy.
4) If you are looking to HOLD, then see if the player's Profit/Coin is higher than the highest entries in the Tax-Adjusted Profit/Coin- if so, then buy. If not, then you're better doing step 3 and then just buying the desired players post IPO.
